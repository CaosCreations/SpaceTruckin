  description: "\u201CThere\u2019s a serious water shortage on Earth (Ha! Remember
    Earth? What a dump!) To be clear, the planet is still covered in water, but it\u2019s
    mostly a radioactive sludge at this point. The president of Eurasia herself has
    ordered four tons of pure ice from the moons of Sakris.<br>If we can get it to
    her quickly this time, we may be able to secure a long-term contract, making
    a delivery every few weeks. Plus, with what they\u2019re used to, I\u2019ll bet
    Earthlings can\u2019t tell the difference between Sakris moon ice and ice from
    the station\u2019s sewage purification system, so we can save a pretty penny
    going forward.\u201D"
