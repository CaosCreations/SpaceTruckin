  description: "\u201CHigh profile\_job\_incoming! You know the Vesta genius artist
    everyone\u2019s always talking about? Can\u2019t stand the guy, what an arrogant
    ass. Anyway, the exhibition for his latest work (which he calls his masterpiece\u2026
    what a prick) is this weekend and they\u2019re sparing no expense to feed guests.
    They\u2019re doing interplanetary fusion cuisine, which is hardly surprising
    for a new-rich event. <br> Anyway, we\u2019ll have some delicate cargo onboard,
    like live Oshunian eels, crispy Helicid Guly leaves, and even a dormant AI chef
    they will update with new ingredient-matching algorithms, so be careful and be
    quick. It\u2019s a one-time\_job, but it should be worth our while. If we pull
    it off, we could nab some new Vesta customers, and it\u2019s never a bad idea
    to be in their good books.\u201D"
