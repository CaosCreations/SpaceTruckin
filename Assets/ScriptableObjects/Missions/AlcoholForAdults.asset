  description: "\u201CI just got off a weird call, where a client requested we deliver
    \u2018a thousand alcohols\u2019. They say it\u2019s for a grown up party. Actually,
    they said \u2018grown up\u2019 A LOT. I\u2019m pretty sure it was just three
    kids stacked on top of each other in their dad\u2019s overcoat. But they paid
    upfront so I didn\u2019t ask any questions. <br> They\u2019re way over in Galak
    so it will be a whole day\u2019s journey through the disputed asteroid belt.
    It\u2019s risky, I know, but did I mention they paid upfront? You can probably
    squeeze a hefty tip out of them too.\u201D "
