  description: "\u201CJust when you thought this year couldn\u2019t get any worse,
    some League of Planet scientists have discovered a new species of parasite on
    one of Xykl\u2019s moons. This thing apparently works its way from your from
    your eyes down to your unmentionables and\u2026 actually, I\u2019ll spare you
    the details, but trust me when I saw you DON\u2019T want this in your eyes.<br>Luckily,
    the League have also discovered this parasite\u2019s natural predator on another
    of Xykl\u2019s moons. It devours the parasite then leaves your body pretty painfully,
    but nowhere near as bad as the parasite. Anyway, the League wants us to deliver
    a shipment of these predators to all planets we can, just in case this parasite
    finds its way off that moon\u2026 which, the way this year has been going, has
    probably already happened.\u201D"
