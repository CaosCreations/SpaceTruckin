  description: "\u201CA group of gun-running pirates wants our help. The League of
    Planets is aware of their activities and has sent a patrol group to monitor their
    known smuggling pathways. They want an arsenal large enough to obliterate a dwarf
    planet, but obviously, we\u2019re not equipped for that.<br>We can, however,
    hide a smaller stash in the middle of a standard delivery of Stooka Cola to get
    past the patrols without raising any red flags. It\u2019s not far and a little
    risky, but they pay well, and they\u2019ll need us a lot. Obviously, this is
    entirely unofficial and you never heard it from me\u2026 Come to think of it,
    I shouldn\u2019t have put this in writing, should I?\u201D"
