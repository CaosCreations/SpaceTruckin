  description: "\u201CAcademia calls! The galaxy\u2019s smartest snail is conducting
    research on that pink slimy mould thing that\u2019s been popping up left, right
    and center. The professor wants to collect mould specimens from around the galaxy
    to study its moldiness or something? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not an academic.<br>I
    may not be as smart as these university folk, but this\_job\_sounds good to me.
    We\u2019ll have some long hauls which we can charge more for, and they\u2019ll
    need us consistently, so we\u2019ll have a steady stream of work. It\u2019s not
    the highest paying\_job, but look at us being all academic and stuff\u2026 doesn\u2019t
    it make you feel smarter?\u201D"
