  description: "Hey there! Yally here.   The old ventilation system isn't what it
    used to be and now the smell of old socks and rust is kind of overpowering everything,
    not to mention that weird rattling you hear whenever you're near a vent. We\u2019re
    not sure exactly where all the original exhaust vents are even located anymore
    but the 37 we DO know of need new parts. We\u2019ve placed an order for an even
    40 so we\u2019ll have spares!    Thanks <3 "
