  description: "\u201CA refugee group escaping oppression on their home planet has
    crash landed on the icy moon of Sakris. I know what you\u2019re thinking, and
    no, we can\u2019t pick them up, our license is for cargo only. Transporting passengers
    would slap a fine on us enough to bankrupt us many times over.<br>But we can
    help by delivering fuel to keep them warm. And once they\u2019re warm, they\u2019ll
    probably need tools and spare parts to fix their ship. Yes, it\u2019s low-paying,
    but come on, these are refugees! Also, if their planet\u2019s army is hunting
    for them, we could find ourselves in the middle of a civil war\u2026 isn\u2019t
    that fun?\u201D"
